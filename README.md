# Dice-game
Two players can enter their usernames and watch to see who wins a game of dice.

First enter your usernames,

Both players get two rolls each round and there are a total of 5 rounds,

After each roll your number gets added to your score,

If you roll an odd number you lose 5 points, if you roll an even number you gain 10 points, if you roll a double in the same round you get to roll again,

After each round your current scores are shown to you,

At the end of the five rounds the winner is displayed and the winning scores of each round are exported to an external file called topscores.
